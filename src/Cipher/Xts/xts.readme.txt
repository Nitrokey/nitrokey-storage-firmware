XTS README
==========

This is an initial implementation of XTS. The files in this archive are
as follows:

1. AES implementation Files (C source)
--------------------------------------

aes.h           AES header file
aesopt.h        AES optimisation options
aestab.h        AES table header

aescrypt.c      AES encrypt/decrypt
aeskey.c        AES key schedule generation
aestab.c        AES tables

brg_endian.h    general purpose endian detection code
brg_types.h     general purpose fixed width type definitions

2. XTS Files (C source)
-----------------------

xts.h           XTS header file   
xts.c           XTS

mode_hdr.h      general purpose support code

xts*.txt        test vector templates for GENTEST

3. GENTEST
----------

GENTEST is a test vector generator which is described in gentest.txt. 
For XTS it is compiled with the code above and then used with a test 
vector template to generate test vectors.  The command:

   gentest  template_file   test_vector_file
   
generates test vectors in 'test_vector_file' from the template in the 
file 'template_file' (the xts*.txt files are examples of templates).

4. MODETEST
-----------
 
MODETEST is compiled with AES and XTS source code and will then run 
GENTEST test vector files and check if the implementation complies with 
the test vectors provided.  The comamnd
 
   modetest input_dir tv_name
   
will process multiple test vector files in the directory 'input_dir' 
with the names tv_name.1, tv_name.2, .... and determine if the program 
under test succeeds in duplicating the results.

4. HELP NEEDED
--------------

I would greatly appreciate help and feedback on the following:

1. Testing the code on big-endian machines with each of the 
   following defines in mode_hdr.h:
   
   a. UNIT_BITS 64
   a. UNIT_BITS 32
   a. UNIT_BITS  8
   
2. The same on Sun systems AND to check that the 32 and 64 bit
   compilers select the correct types in brg_types.h (for the
   64-bit type in particular).

My thanks to anyone who is able to help.
